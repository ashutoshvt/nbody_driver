abstract = {The basis set superposition effect (BSSE) arises in electronic structure calculations of molecular clusters when questions relating to interactions between monomers within the larger cluster are asked. The binding energy, or total energy, of the cluster may be broken down into many smaller subcluster calculations and the energies of these subsystems linearly combined to, hopefully, produce the desired quantity of interest. Unfortunately, BSSE can plague these smaller fragment calculations. In this work, we carefully examine the major sources of error associated with reproducing the binding energy and total energy of a molecular cluster. In order to do so, we decompose these energies in terms of a many-body expansion (MBE), where a “body” here refers to the monomers that make up the cluster. In our analysis, we found it necessary to introduce something we designate here as a many-ghost many-body expansion (MGMBE). The work presented here produces some surprising results, but perhaps the most significant of...},

abstract = {Properties of four chiral compounds-(S)- methyloxirane, (S)-methylthiirane, (S)-2-chloropropionitrile, and (M)-dimethylallene-centered in a solvation shell of six to seven water molecules have been computed using time-dependent density functional theory at several wavelengths using a many-body expansion. Interaction energies, total system dipole moments, and dynamic dipole polarizabilities converge rapidly and smoothly, exhibiting only minor oscillations with higher-body contributions. At three-body truncation of the expansion, errors in such properties as compared to the full cluster typically fall to less than 1 {\%} (and much smaller in most cases). Specific optical rotations, however, are found to converge much more slowly and erratically, requiring five-body contributions to obtain errors less than 5 {\%} in three of four test cases, and six-body terms for (S)-methylthiirane. The source of this behavior is found to be the wide variation of both magnitude and sign of the specific rotation with changes in the configuration of individual solute/solvent clusters. Thus, unlike simpler properties such as energies or dipole moments, where each fragment makes a small, same-sign contribution to the total property, specific rotations typically involve much larger contributions that partly cancel in the many-body expansion. Thus, the computational costs of molecular dynamics simulations of explicit solvation, for example, will be only partially alleviated by such expansions. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

@article{Mayer2017,
abstract = {The problem of performing many-body decompositions of energy is considered in the case when BSSE corrections are also performed. It is discussed that the two different schemes that have been proposed go back to the two different interpretations of the original Boys–Bernardi counterpoise correction scheme. It is argued that from the physical point of view the “hierarchical” scheme of Valiron and Mayer should be preferred and not the scheme recently discussed by Ouyang and Bettens, because it permits the energy of the individual monomers and all the two-body, three-body, etc. energy components to be free of unphysical dependence on the arrangement (basis functions) of other subsystems in the cluster.},

@article{Turi1993,
abstract = {The counterpoise correction (CP) for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) for multimolecular aggregates can (in principle) be calculated by several different procedures, which give significantly different results. Three of these procedures arc discussed and illustrated with the HF...(HF)n...HF H-bonding aggregate. The three methods are (a) proceeding as if a dimer were formed between a unit of HF added to the H end of the growing aggregate, (b) as above, but with the HF being added to the F end, and (c) using the difference between the calculated CPs for the two aggregates before and after addition of the last HF, where the CPs for each aggregate are calculated using each monomeric unit in each aggregate with the ghost orbitals of all the other monomers. To separate the coupled effects cf BSSE and geometric optimization, the calculations were carried out on structures with both fixed and optimized H-F and F...H distances. Calculations were performed using the 6-31G, 6-31G(d), and 6-31G(d,p) basis sets at both the Hartree-Fock and MP2 levels. The significant differences in both the values and the trends of the CPs calculated by the different methods illustrate the need to use caution when applying the CP correction.},

@article{Ouyang2016,
abstract = {Many-body effects are required for an accurate description of both structure and dynamics of large chemical systems. However, there are numerous such interactions to consider, and it is not obvious which ones are significant. We provide a general and fast method for establishing which small set of three- and four-body interactions are important. This is achieved by estimating the maximum many-body effects, ϵmax, that can arise in a given arrangement of bodies. Through careful analysis of ϵmax, we find two overall causes for significant many-body interactions. First, many-body induction propagates in nonbranching paths, that is, in a chain-like manner. Second, linear arrangements of bodies promote the alignment of the dipoles to reinforce the many-body interaction. Consequently, compact and extended linear arrangements are favored. The latter result is not intuitive as these linear arrangements can lead to significant many-body effects extending over large distances. For the first time, this study provides...},
